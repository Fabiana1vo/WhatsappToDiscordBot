1. As the bot will create some files, create a new folder in a directory you wish to prevent cluttering. Then, move the downloaded file to that folder.

1. Now, go back to the file you downloaded, and run it! (Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may warn you about running the executable as this project is quite small and not well-known, but if you feel unsafe, you can always inspect and run the open source code from GitHub using Node. To skip SmartScreen, you can click on *"More Info"*, then *"Run"*)
